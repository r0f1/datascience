# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Suggestions can include packages, blog entries, books, talks on youtube, tutorials, code snippets, links to other repos etc. But make sure [everything is awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQgQIMlwWw). 
- Suggested packages should be awesome and documented.
- Suggested packages should not be too old. If a package has not been maintained for 7 years, maybe do not add it. Use your best judgement. 
- Check if you package is a duplicate. Duplicates are okay, only if a package belongs to more than one category. If you want to add a package about time series anomaly detection, it is okay to add it to both the time series and the anomaly detection section. 
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format for packages: `[PACKAGE](LINK) - DESCRIPTION  `. Notice the two trailing whitespaces. These are important.
- If you propose something other than a package, you might use a different format.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.

Thank you for your suggestions!
